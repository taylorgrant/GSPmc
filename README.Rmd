# mcSurvey

Code to scrape [Morning Consult](www.morningconsult.com) for all stories, iterate through all stories looking for pdf crosstabs. Code then downloads all pdfs, reads in the TOC for each survey, and builds a table of all questions asked. Survey pdfs are placed in a Box folder and the TOC is written to an html file that also lives at the Box location.

Take something like this:

And have it look like this
